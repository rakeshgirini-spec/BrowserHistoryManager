Project Description â€“ Browser History Manager

This project is a console-based application developed in C that simulates a simple browser history manager using a doubly linked list data structure. Each node in the list represents a visited website URL and supports efficient bidirectional navigation.

The program allows users to perform all major browser history operations, including:

Visiting a new website (inserting a new node).

Deleting a specific website from history.

Displaying the entire browsing history.

Navigating backward and forward through visited sites.

Clearing the entire history at once.

To enhance functionality, the project integrates at least one searching algorithm (such as Linear or Binary Search) to quickly locate a website in history and one sorting algorithm (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Quick, or Merge Sort) to organize the URLs alphabetically.
